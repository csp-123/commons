# ArrayList 和 LinkedList 区别：

## ArrayList:
查询效率高，因为基于动态数组，连续内存存储，适合下标访问，随机访问，有动态扩容机制。
如果初始容量合理，并且尾插的话，插入效率不比LinkedList差，如果涉及到扩容，不是尾插的话，还会涉及数组的移动，效率就会低一些。
## LinkedList:
插入删除效率高，因为基于链表，不适合查询，查询时会遍历链表，遍历时推荐使用iterator，for循环性能消耗极大。



## ArrayList的扩容机制：

每次add操作时，会进行判读，当集合当前的元素数量达到集合的容量时，会进行扩容，扩容时，单次add时，扩容是扩至1.5倍，原容量右移一位，加上原容量，addAll时，新增元素量大于原容量的一半时，扩容为原容量加新增元素量。

public class Demo{
    /**
     * Computes a new array length given an array's current length, a minimum growth
     * amount, and a preferred growth amount. The computation is done in an overflow-safe
     * fashion.
     *
     * This method is used by objects that contain an array that might need to be grown
     * in order to fulfill some immediate need (the minimum growth amount) but would also
     * like to request more space (the preferred growth amount) in order to accommodate
     * potential future needs. The returned length is usually clamped at the soft maximum
     * length in order to avoid hitting the JVM implementation limit. However, the soft
     * maximum will be exceeded if the minimum growth amount requires it.
     *
     * If the preferred growth amount is less than the minimum growth amount, the
     * minimum growth amount is used as the preferred growth amount.
     *
     * The preferred length is determined by adding the preferred growth amount to the
     * current length. If the preferred length does not exceed the soft maximum length
     * (SOFT_MAX_ARRAY_LENGTH) then the preferred length is returned.
     *
     * If the preferred length exceeds the soft maximum, we use the minimum growth
     * amount. The minimum required length is determined by adding the minimum growth
     * amount to the current length. If the minimum required length exceeds Integer.MAX_VALUE,
     * then this method throws OutOfMemoryError. Otherwise, this method returns the greater of
     * the soft maximum or the minimum required length.
     *
     * Note that this method does not do any array allocation itself; it only does array
     * length growth computations. However, it will throw OutOfMemoryError as noted above.
     *
     * Note also that this method cannot detect the JVM's implementation limit, and it
     * may compute and return a length value up to and including Integer.MAX_VALUE that
     * might exceed the JVM's implementation limit. In that case, the caller will likely
     * attempt an array allocation with that length and encounter an OutOfMemoryError.
     * Of course, regardless of the length value returned from this method, the caller
     * may encounter OutOfMemoryError if there is insufficient heap to fulfill the request.
     *
     * @param oldLength   current length of the array (must be nonnegative)
     * @param minGrowth   minimum required growth amount (must be positive)
     * @param prefGrowth  preferred growth amount
     * @return the new array length
     * @throws OutOfMemoryError if the new length would exceed Integer.MAX_VALUE
